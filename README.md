## Project context
Social media platforms do not publish annual summaries of how much time users spend scrolling, how often they check their feeds, or what that attention ultimately funds. While usage metrics are central to how these platforms operate and monetise engagement, they are rarely presented back to users in a reflective or self-critical way.

At the same time, platforms like Spotify, ChatGPT, and Reddit have popularised end-of-year "wrapped" recaps as a form of data-driven storytelling. These engaging and personalized experiences reframe data as entertainment, encouraging users to celebrate their habits and traits.

This project imagines what a similar “Wrapped” experience might look like if applied to social media "doomscrolling"; not to optimise engagement, but to expose it. By presenting simple metrics with a satirical twist, the site positions addictive scrolling as a behavior worth reflecting on.

The statistics and information used are intentionally based on realistic averages rather than extreme outliers. The goal is not to shock with exaggerated numbers, but to make the experience feel uncomfortably plausible.
